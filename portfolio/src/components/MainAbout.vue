            <p class="text-lg font-roboto text-justify">Hello there. My name is Amir Skoric and I am 22 years old. I come from Bornholm,
                which might surprise some of you. I study at “IBA Erhvervsakademi Kolding”, where I am studying for the
                “Webdeveloper” education. I am already a “Multimediedesigner” graduate.<br><br>

                I consider myself to be a reasonable person. I may be on the quiet side, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t
                want to talk to you, It’s just that I’ve been suffering from social anxiety ever since I was a kid
                🙃<br><br>

                My favorite hobbies include playing video games and producing music, although I have many more. Most of my
                free time is spent in front of a computer, and I would consider myself to be fluent in both the Microsoft
                Windows and Apples MacOS operating system.</p>
